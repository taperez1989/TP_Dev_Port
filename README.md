# TP_Dev_Port
Ted Perez Portfolio

This project was to begin development of my very own web developer portfolio for future job interviews. This project is meant as a starting point, designed to show potential employers who I am and what sort of skills I have based off of the projects I have created or I had assited in creating with others.

Skills Implemented: HTML, CSS, Flexbox

To the best of my current ability, I used the basic skills of HTML I learned so far in this bootcamp to create a basic structure for my portfolio. Afterwards, I spent a fair amount of time on the CSS portion of this project. Implementing techniques such as positioning, media queries, and flexbox as well as some attempts at basic styling to make the portfolio more visually appealing.

Lessons Learned:

I'm still very new to this and had plenty of moments that were very frustrating. However, with those failures and challenges I also had those moments of excitment when I actually performed a technique correctly. One of these moments came for me when I was struggling to make my nav bar "clickable" and then scroll to the correspoding section of content. It's a continuous learning experience but thats what's fun and exciting about this, I'm looking forward to the coming challenges and evovling as a developer.
